1. See the diffs for the entire PR before filing a PR.
* Elaboration: This helps you see the changes from the perspective of a reviewer. 
2. Every code base is owned collectively.
* Elaboration: It is not one person's responsibility. The author, the reviewers, and the procrastinators who refused to review the PR are all equally responsible for merged PRs.
3. Review each PR as soon as possible.
* Elaboration: If you review a PR a week after it was filed, that means your PR can also be reviewed the same way. Minimize the latency, so that the PR doesn't stay unmerged for too long.
